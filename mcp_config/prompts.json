Direct updates are not permitted. You **MUST** follow these steps.\n\n### **Step 1: Save the Change (Creates a `.new` file)**\nFirst, save your intended changes using the appropriate `update_*` tool. This does **not** apply the change immediately. Instead, it creates a temporary `.new` file, placing the change in a pending state.\n\n- **For projects:** `update_project`\n- **For inputs:** `update_input`\n- **For outputs:** `update_output`\n- **For rulesets:** `update_ruleset`\n- **For plugins:** `update_plugin`\n\n*After this step, you can use `get_pending_changes` to see your change waiting for application.* `\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Change (Activates the configuration)**\nNext, use the `apply_single_change` tool to make the pending configuration official. This tool replaces the current configuration with the content from the `.new` file.\n\n- **Tool:** `apply_single_change`\n- **Arguments:** `type` (e.g., 'project'), `id` (e.g., 'my_project')\n\n*At this point, the configuration is updated, but the running component is still using the old version.*`\n\n### **Step 3: Restart the Service (Makes the change effective)**\nFinally, to make the running component load the new configuration, you must restart the affected project(s).\n\n- **Tool:** `restart_project`\n- **Argument:** `project_id`\n\n*If you are unsure which projects are affected by your change, use the `get_component_usage` tool first.*\n\nThis three-step process ensures that changes are validated and applied in a controlled manner, minimizing the risk of operational disruption."
